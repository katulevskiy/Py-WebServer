# Python Web Server

In this repo I create a python web server.
It has several complexity iterations:

- basic request handler
- request handler with redirection to Flask app
- iterative handler
- concurrent request handling
- concurrent request handling with zombie killing and flooding protection

I recommend using main-ws.py
Good luck and have a nice day!
